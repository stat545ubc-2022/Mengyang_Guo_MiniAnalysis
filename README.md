# Wecome to Mengyang Guo's Mini data analysis 
This repository save the files for Mengyang Guo's Mini data analysis for UBC stat545 course.
The aim of this project is to explore the tumor characters and tumore diagnosis. I first cleaned the tumor data and then performed regression analysis. I find that the tumor radius and smoothness can predict whether a tumor is malicous or not.

To engage with this data, please note that this mini analysis mainly consist of two milestones Mini data analysis I and II. They are stored in according folders. Another folder is the output folder to models and tables. Every level-1 folder has a README file, explaining in a sentence or two what is in the folder.

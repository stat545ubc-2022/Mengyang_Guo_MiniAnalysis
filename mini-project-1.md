Mini Data-Analysis Deliverable 1
================

# Welcome to your (maybe) first-ever data analysis project!

And hopefully the first of many. Let’s get started:

1.  Install the [`datateachr`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr)
    package by typing the following into your **R terminal**:

<!-- -->

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/datateachr")

2.  Load the packages below.

``` r
library(datateachr)
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──
    ## ✔ ggplot2 3.3.6      ✔ purrr   0.3.5 
    ## ✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10
    ## ✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 
    ## ✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()

3.  Make a repository in the <https://github.com/stat545ubc-2022>
    Organization. You will be working with this repository for the
    entire data analysis project. You can either make it public, or make
    it private and add the TA’s and Lucy as collaborators. A link to
    help you create a private repository is available on the
    \#collaborative-project Slack channel.

# Instructions

## For Both Milestones

- Each milestone is worth 45 points. The number of points allocated to
  each task will be annotated within each deliverable. Tasks that are
  more challenging will often be allocated more points.

- 10 points will be allocated to the reproducibility, cleanliness, and
  coherence of the overall analysis. While the two milestones will be
  submitted as independent deliverables, the analysis itself is a
  continuum - think of it as two chapters to a story. Each chapter, or
  in this case, portion of your analysis, should be easily followed
  through by someone unfamiliar with the content.
  [Here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/06-best-practices-R/)
  is a good resource for what constitutes “good code”. Learning good
  coding practices early in your career will save you hassle later on!

## For Milestone 1

**To complete this milestone**, edit [this very `.Rmd`
file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBC-STAT/stat545.stat.ubc.ca/master/content/mini-project/mini-project-1.Rmd)
directly. Fill in the sections that are tagged with
`<!--- start your work below --->`.

**To submit this milestone**, make sure to knit this `.Rmd` file to an
`.md` file by changing the YAML output settings from
`output: html_document` to `output: github_document`. Commit and push
all of your work to the mini-analysis GitHub repository you made
earlier, and tag a release on GitHub. Then, submit a link to your tagged
release on canvas.

**Points**: This milestone is worth 45 points: 43 for your analysis, 1
point for having your Milestone 1 document knit error-free, and 1 point
for tagging your release on Github.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this milestone, you should:

- Become familiar with your dataset of choosing
- Select 4 questions that you would like to answer with your data
- Generate a reproducible and clear report using R Markdown
- Become familiar with manipulating and summarizing your data in tibbles
  using `dplyr`, with a research question in mind.

# Task 1: Choose your favorite dataset (10 points)

The `datateachr` package by Hayley Boyce and Jordan Bourak currently
composed of 7 semi-tidy datasets for educational purposes. Here is a
brief description of each dataset:

- *apt_buildings*: Acquired courtesy of The City of Toronto’s Open Data
  Portal. It currently has 3455 rows and 37 columns.

- *building_permits*: Acquired courtesy of The City of Vancouver’s Open
  Data Portal. It currently has 20680 rows and 14 columns.

- *cancer_sample*: Acquired courtesy of UCI Machine Learning Repository.
  It currently has 569 rows and 32 columns.

- *flow_sample*: Acquired courtesy of The Government of Canada’s
  Historical Hydrometric Database. It currently has 218 rows and 7
  columns.

- *parking_meters*: Acquired courtesy of The City of Vancouver’s Open
  Data Portal. It currently has 10032 rows and 22 columns.

- *steam_games*: Acquired courtesy of Kaggle. It currently has 40833
  rows and 21 columns.

- *vancouver_trees*: Acquired courtesy of The City of Vancouver’s Open
  Data Portal. It currently has 146611 rows and 20 columns.

**Things to keep in mind**

- We hope that this project will serve as practice for carrying our your
  own *independent* data analysis. Remember to comment your code, be
  explicit about what you are doing, and write notes in this markdown
  document when you feel that context is required. As you advance in the
  project, prompts and hints to do this will be diminished - it’ll be up
  to you!

- Before choosing a dataset, you should always keep in mind **your
  goal**, or in other ways, *what you wish to achieve with this data*.
  This mini data-analysis project focuses on *data wrangling*,
  *tidying*, and *visualization*. In short, it’s a way for you to get
  your feet wet with exploring data on your own.

And that is exactly the first thing that you will do!

1.1 Out of the 7 datasets available in the `datateachr` package, choose
**4** that appeal to you based on their description. Write your choices
below:

**Note**: We encourage you to use the ones in the `datateachr` package,
but if you have a dataset that you’d really like to use, you can include
it here. But, please check with a member of the teaching team to see
whether the dataset is of appropriate complexity. Also, include a
**brief** description of the dataset here to help the teaching team
understand your data.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

1: `vancouver_trees`  
2: `steam_games`  
3:`cancer_sample`  
4: `flow_sample`

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

1.2 One way to narrowing down your selection is to *explore* the
datasets. Use your knowledge of dplyr to find out at least *3*
attributes about each of these datasets (an attribute is something such
as number of rows, variables, class type…). The goal here is to have an
idea of *what the data looks like*.

*Hint:* This is one of those times when you should think about the
cleanliness of your analysis. I added a single code chunk for you below,
but do you want to use more than one? Would you like to write more
comments outside of the code chunk?

- **I use glimpse function for these sample.**

- **For cancer sample, I find that there are 569 rows and 32 columns.
  Only the diagnosis variable is a character varialble. Everything else
  is numeric.**

- **I repeat this process for the rest of 3 data sets.**

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

1.3 Now that you’ve explored the 4 datasets that you were initially most
interested in, let’s narrow it down to 2. What lead you to choose these
2? Briefly explain your choices below, and feel free to include any code
in your explanation.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

**I would like to dig deeper into the vancouver_trees and the
cancer_sample.**  
  
**I’m interested in vancouver trees because it has a lot of character
variables for which I could perform textual analysis.**  
  
**I’m also interested in cancer_sample because I could use these factors
in the data to predict a tumor’s diagnosis.**

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

1.4 Time for the final decision! Going back to the beginning, it’s
important to have an *end goal* in mind. For example, if I had chosen
the `titanic` dataset for my project, I might’ve wanted to explore the
relationship between survival and other variables. Try to think of 1
research question that you would want to answer with each dataset. Note
them down below, and make your final choice based on what seems more
interesting to you!

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

**I would like to study the cancer_sample because it would allow me to
explore what quantitative factors affect the tumor’s diagnosis. The
dataset already comes with the categorical outcome variable, diagnosis,
and some explanatory quantitaitve variables such as radius_mean,
texture_mean.**

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

# Important note

Read Tasks 2 and 3 *fully* before starting to complete either of them.
Probably also a good point to grab a coffee to get ready for the fun
part!

This project is semi-guided, but meant to be *independent*. For this
reason, you will complete tasks 2 and 3 below (under the **START HERE**
mark) as if you were writing your own exploratory data analysis report,
and this guidance never existed! Feel free to add a brief introduction
section to your project, format the document with markdown syntax as you
deem appropriate, and structure the analysis as you deem appropriate.
Remember, marks will be awarded for completion of the 4 tasks, but 10
points of the whole project are allocated to a reproducible and clean
analysis. If you feel lost, you can find a sample data analysis
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/headsortails/tidy-titarnic) to have a
better idea. However, bear in mind that it is **just an example** and
you will not be required to have that level of complexity in your
project.

# Task 2: Exploring your dataset (15 points)

If we rewind and go back to the learning objectives, you’ll see that by
the end of this deliverable, you should have formulated *4* research
questions about your data that you may want to answer during your
project. However, it may be handy to do some more exploration on your
dataset of choice before creating these questions - by looking at the
data, you may get more ideas. **Before you start this task, read all
instructions carefully until you reach START HERE under Task 3**.

2.1 Complete *4 out of the following 8 exercises* to dive deeper into
your data. All datasets are different and therefore, not all of these
tasks may make sense for your data - which is why you should only answer
*4*. Use *dplyr* and *ggplot*.

1.  Plot the distribution of a numeric variable.
2.  Create a new variable based on other variables in your data (only if
    it makes sense)
3.  Investigate how many missing values there are per variable. Can you
    find a way to plot this?
4.  Explore the relationship between 2 variables in a plot.
5.  Filter observations in your data according to your own criteria.
    Think of what you’d like to explore - again, if this was the
    `titanic` dataset, I may want to narrow my search down to passengers
    born in a particular year…
6.  Use a boxplot to look at the frequency of different observations
    within a single variable. You can do this for more than one variable
    if you wish!
7.  Make a new tibble with a subset of your data, with variables and
    observations that you are interested in exploring.
8.  Use a density plot to explore any of your variables (that are
    suitable for this type of plot).

2.2 For each of the 4 exercises that you complete, provide a *brief
explanation* of why you chose that exercise in relation to your data (in
other words, why does it make sense to do that?), and sufficient
comments for a reader to understand your reasoning and code.

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

**Excercise 1: Plot the distribution of tumor mean radius. This helps me
understand the distribution of tumor size.**

``` r
cancer_sample <- as.tibble(datateachr::cancer_sample)
```

    ## Warning: `as.tibble()` was deprecated in tibble 2.0.0.
    ## ℹ Please use `as_tibble()` instead.
    ## ℹ The signature and semantics have changed, see `?as_tibble`.

``` r
cancer_sample %>%
  pull(radius_mean) %>%
  qplot()
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](mini-project-1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Looks like it is not normally distributed. Most tumors’ radius is
between 10-20.

**Excercise 2: Any missing values? Any missing values should be dropped.
So I check missing value here**

``` r
any(is.na(cancer_sample))
```

    ## [1] FALSE

No, there is not any missing value. Good to go!

**Excercise 3: Filter observations to Malignant tumors.** I focus on
Malignant tumors because I was wondering Malignant tumors’ size

``` r
filter(cancer_sample,diagnosis == "M")
```

Looks like bad tumor tends to be larger…

**Excercise 4: To explore the relationship between texture_mean and
radius_mean, I plot these two variables with tumor diagnosis showing in
different color.**

``` r
ggplot(cancer_sample, aes(x=texture_mean,y=radius_mean,colour=diagnosis))+
  geom_point()
```

![](mini-project-1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Looks like tumor with large radius and texture scores are more likely to
be Malignant.

# Task 3: Write your research questions (5 points)

So far, you have chosen a dataset and gotten familiar with it through
exploring the data. Now it’s time to figure out 4 research questions
that you would like to answer with your data! Write the 4 questions and
any additional comments at the end of this deliverable. These questions
are not necessarily set in stone - TAs will review them and give you
feedback; therefore, you may choose to pursue them as they are for the
rest of the project, or make modifications!

<!--- *****START HERE***** --->

**Q1: Does the size of a tumor predicts whether it is malignant versus
benign?**  
**Q2: If yes, is this relation mostly driven by some extreme values of
tumor size?**  
**Q3: Does the smoothness of a tumor predicts whether it is malignant
versus benign?**  
**Q4:** **Does non-smooth tumor is very likely to be benign tumor?**

<!----------------------------->

# Task 4: Process and summarize your data (13 points)

From Task 2, you should have an idea of the basic structure of your
dataset (e.g. number of rows and columns, class types, etc.). Here, we
will start investigating your data more in-depth using various data
manipulation functions.

### 1.1 (10 points)

Now, for each of your four research questions, choose one task from
options 1-4 (summarizing), and one other task from 4-8 (graphing). You
should have 2 tasks done for each research question (8 total). Make sure
it makes sense to do them! (e.g. don’t use a numerical variables for a
task that needs a categorical variable.). Comment on why each task helps
(or doesn’t!) answer the corresponding research question.

Ensure that the output of each operation is printed!

**Summarizing:**

1.  Compute the *range*, *mean*, and *two other summary statistics* of
    **one numerical variable** across the groups of **one categorical
    variable** from your data.
2.  Compute the number of observations for at least one of your
    categorical variables. Do not use the function `table()`!
3.  Create a categorical variable with 3 or more groups from an existing
    numerical variable. You can use this new variable in the other
    tasks! *An example: age in years into “child, teen, adult, senior”.*
4.  Based on two categorical variables, calculate two summary statistics
    of your choosing.

**Graphing:**

5.  Create a graph out of summarized variables that has at least two
    geom layers.
6.  Create a graph of your choosing, make one of the axes logarithmic,
    and format the axes labels so that they are “pretty” or easier to
    read.
7.  Make a graph where it makes sense to customize the alpha
    transparency.
8.  Create 3 histograms out of summarized variables, with each histogram
    having different sized bins. Pick the “best” one and explain why it
    is the best.

Make sure it’s clear what research question you are doing each operation
for!

<!------------------------- Start your work below ----------------------------->

**Q1: Does the size of a tumor predicts whether it is malignant versus
benign?**  
*`Summarizing:`*  
What is the *range*, *mean*, median and standard deviation of t**he size
of a tumor** across **malignant versus benign?**

``` r
cancer_sample %>%
  group_by(diagnosis)%>%
  summarise(radius_average=mean(radius_mean),radius_median=median(radius_mean),radius_range=range(radius_mean),radius_sd=sd(radius_mean))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'diagnosis'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 5
    ## # Groups:   diagnosis [2]
    ##   diagnosis radius_average radius_median radius_range radius_sd
    ##   <chr>              <dbl>         <dbl>        <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1 B                   12.1          12.2         6.98      1.78
    ## 2 B                   12.1          12.2        17.8       1.78
    ## 3 M                   17.5          17.3        11.0       3.20
    ## 4 M                   17.5          17.3        28.1       3.20

Looks like The *mean* across **malignant versus benign** can help
explain whether it is related to tumor diagnosis. The size is smaller
for benign tumor.  
  
*`Graphing:`*  
I will create a graph, making one of the radius logarithmic, and
formatting the axes labels so that they are “pretty” or easier to read.

``` r
cancer_sample %>%
    ggplot(aes(diagnosis, radius_mean))+
    geom_jitter()+
    scale_y_log10(labs(x = "radius_mean_level"))
```

![](mini-project-1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

Yes, it seems that greater size is correlated with bad tumor  
  
**Q2: Does the result driven by some extreme values of tumor size?**  
*`Summarizing:`*  
I will compute the number of observations for diagnosis outcome!

``` r
summary(as.factor(cancer_sample$diagnosis)) 
```

    ##   B   M 
    ## 357 212

*`Graphing:`*  
I will plot the (extreme) values of tumor size and customize the alpha
transparency.

``` r
ggplot(cancer_sample, aes(diagnosis, smoothness_mean)) +
     geom_point(alpha=0.2)
```

![](mini-project-1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

I find that the results are not driven by the extreme values.

**Q3: Does the smoothness of a tumor predicts whether it is malignant
versus benign?**  
  
*`Summarizing:`*

``` r
cancer_sample %>%
  group_by(diagnosis)%>%
  summarise(smoothness_average=mean(smoothness_mean),smoothness_median=median(smoothness_mean),smoothness_range=range(smoothness_mean),smoothness_sd=sd(smoothness_mean))
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'diagnosis'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 5
    ## # Groups:   diagnosis [2]
    ##   diagnosis smoothness_average smoothness_median smoothness_range smoothness_sd
    ##   <chr>                  <dbl>             <dbl>            <dbl>         <dbl>
    ## 1 B                     0.0925            0.0908           0.0526        0.0134
    ## 2 B                     0.0925            0.0908           0.163         0.0134
    ## 3 M                     0.103             0.102            0.0737        0.0126
    ## 4 M                     0.103             0.102            0.145         0.0126

It’s very hard to tell whether the smoothness is associated with tumor
diagnosis.  
  
*`Graphing:`*

``` r
ggplot(cancer_sample, aes( smoothness_mean,diagnosis)) +
     ggridges::geom_density_ridges()
```

    ## Picking joint bandwidth of 0.00377

![](mini-project-1_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

Again, from this plot, it’s very hard to tell whether the smoothness is
associated with tumor diagnosis.

**Q4: Does non-smooth tumor is very likely to be benign?**

*`Summarizing:`*  
I will create a categorical variable with 3 groups from smoothness —
“very smooth”, “smooth”, and “not smooth”.

``` r
cancer_sample %>%
  mutate(Smooth_cat = if_else(smoothness_mean>0.1,"very smooth",
                          if_else(smoothness_mean>0.08, "smooth", "not smooth")
                          ))
```

The result suggests that for ***non-smooth*** **tumor**, it is very
likely to be **benign—a very good news to non smooth tumor patients.**

### 1.2 (3 points)

Based on the operations that you’ve completed, how much closer are you
to answering your research questions? Think about what aspects of your
research questions remain unclear. Can your research questions be
refined, now that you’ve investigated your data a bit more? Which
research questions are yielding interesting results?

<!-------------------------- Start your work below ---------------------------->

**I think I learned a lot from this data and closer to my questions.**

**Research question 4 yields interesting results—it shows non-smooth
tumor is very unlikely to be malignant. I think it is a good news for
those patients having non-smooth tumor.**

**Some other things remain unclear. For example, since we have many
predictors of tumor, they are highly correlated. Can we use just a few
factors to describe these predictors?**
